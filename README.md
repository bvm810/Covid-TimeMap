# Covid TimeMap Project
Project of a Covid-19 timelapse map with confirmed cases around the globe day by day since 22/jan/2020. It gets data using the sources and methodologies available in https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report, and outputs an HTML file containing a heat map with the evolution of cases through time

## Instructions
